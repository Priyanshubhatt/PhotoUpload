# PhotoUpload

This is a fully functional Python web server with the capability of uploading photos, 
files and being able to retrieve them from the server. There are two major components, 
the front-end in which the client asks the user to browse for a file, then the client 
sends a request to the back-end side of the server where the file is accepted and saved.
